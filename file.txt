Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is adapted for a different, but related, task. Instead of training a model from scratch, you start with a pre-trained model on a large dataset and then fine-tune it on your specific task or dataset. This leverages the knowledge gained by the model during the initial training, often resulting in faster convergence and improved performance, especially when you have limited labeled data for your specific task.
